## Description

This project takes in user inoput from the command line using the inquirer package, and then based on those responses will generate an svg file, with properties
corresponding to the user input. It also uses jest to test each case to ensure it is working correctly. For instace, if the user would like an svg
shaped as a square there is a dedicated test.js file for square, as well as for each of the other types of shapes.
